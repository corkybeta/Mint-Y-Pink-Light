# Mint-Y-Pink-Light
A GTK theme based on Mint-Y

All references to \#3770aa should be removed and replaced with \#f58d81. Other changes have been made to remove blues and bold fonts.

Currently i need to fix both the applet volume slider and the keyboard volume slider as they are white instead of pink. Also all assets are still blue so checkboxes and a few others need fixing.
